# EW-radiative-corrections-at-One-Loop
More specifically, this dedicates to calculations of fermionic one loop corrections to vector gauge bosons.
FeynCalc 9.2.0 with FeynArts patched is needed. Package-X is also needed if one wants to check the UV cancellation explicitly.
This repository contains several mma files corresponding to each types of gauge bosons' self energy corrections. One has to run them all to run the renormalization.nb.
Here I use on-shell scheme for renormalization.
